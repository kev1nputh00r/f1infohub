F1InfoHub is a Formula 1 information portal I created using Lovable, a modern visual development tool that integrates seamlessly with code. Inspired by the official Formula 1 website, this project focuses on delivering a fast, clean, and responsive UI to explore drivers, teams, circuits, and race results from both the 2023 and 2024 seasons.
Follow these steps to run the code:

```sh
# Step 1: Clone the repository using the project's Git URL.
git clone <YOUR_GIT_URL>

# Step 2: Navigate to the project directory.
cd <YOUR_PROJECT_NAME>

# Step 3: Install the necessary dependencies.
npm i

# Step 4: Start the development server with auto-reloading and an instant preview.
npm run dev
```
